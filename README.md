* The Auction project is a full-stack application that facilitates online auctions. It comprises of a frontend and backend, each serving specific purposes and interacting with each other. The client side features a GUI that provides an intuitive, user-freindly layout for the auction site, allowing users to interact with the system and perform various actions.

* User interactions triggers specific events and sends requests to the server side -- these requests are then processed by the server side, which stores the relevant information in a MongoDB noSQL database. The messages sent from the client side can contain data such as item details, account names, or general messages that may impact other aspects of the program.

* Designed front-end (login, account creation, and auction page) using JavaFX and SceneBuilder and back-end (login
authentication, account storage, and user routing) using MongoDB and password encryption libraries

* Implemented a HTTP-Like protocol that allows client user to communicate to the server back-end and MongoDB
database
